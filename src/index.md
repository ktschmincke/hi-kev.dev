I am a front-end developer with a focus on user experience, accessibility, and human-centered design. I pride myself on collaborating closely and effectively with UX designers to create the perfect implementation for their vision.

My front-end skills form the vertical bar on my [T-shaped skillset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills), or my depth of knowledge. The horizontal bar of the T &mdash; representing my breadth of knowledge &mdash; encompasses all facets of software development.

I'm always seeking opportunities to learn and to teach. My career has been shaped by mentoring and knowledge sharing in both directions.
